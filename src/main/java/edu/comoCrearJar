To create a JAR file from a Maven project in
IntelliJ IDEA, go to the Maven Tool Window
(View → Tool Windows → Maven), expand your project in
the tree, expand Lifecycle, and then double-click on
package. Maven will compile your package, and the
compiled JAR file will be written to the
target/ directory.
